# Project overview

The second code-along NumPy implementation by the NeuralNine youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqW3aPSPIhc. This project is an implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes estimator, and begins with reviewing the core mathematics of a Gaussian distribution before introducing the assumptions and deriving the prediction rule.

## Summary

Aside from further cementing my statistical knowlege, this build handles computational underflow using a log-probability approach.

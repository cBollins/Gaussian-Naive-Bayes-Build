I remember this story from a random documentary, but I found it written on Quora by a fullstack dev named Nanda:

The number 1729 is famously known as the Hardy-Ramanujan number due to a fascinating anecdote involving the Indian mathematical genius 
Srinivasa Ramanujan and the British mathematician G.H. Hardy. This story, which took place in 1918, highlights Ramanujan’s extraordinary 
ability to recognize unique properties of numbers instantly.

** The Taxicab Incident: **

When Hardy visited Ramanujan in a hospital near London, where Ramanujan was being treated for tuberculosis, he arrived in a taxi with 
the number 1729. Upon entering Ramanujan’s room, Hardy mentioned that he thought the number was rather dull and hoped it wasn’t an 
unfavorable omen.

Ramanujan, however, immediately responded by saying, “No, Hardy! It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible
as the sum of two cubes in two different ways”.

** Mathematical Significance: **

Ramanujan’s observation about 1729 was correct and can be demonstrated as follows:

1. 1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 1 + 1728

2. 1729 = 9³ + 10³ = 729 + 1000

This property makes 1729 the smallest taxicab number, which is defined as a number that can be expressed as the sum of two positive 
cubes in more than one way.

** Historical Context: **

It’s worth noting that while this incident popularized the number 1729, it had been noted for its unique properties before. French 
mathematician Frénicle de Bessy had observed this property of 1729 as early as 1657.

** Legacy: **

The Hardy-Ramanujan number showcases not only Ramanujan’s exceptional mathematical insight but also his ability to find fascinating 
properties in seemingly ordinary numbers. This incident has become one of the most well-known anecdotes in mathematical history, cementing
1729’s place in mathematical lore.

Today, a commemorative plaque marks the site of this famous conversation at 2 Colinette Road in Putney, London. The number 1729 continues
to fascinate mathematicians and has led to further explorations in number theory and related fields.
